## 100 - Your Airtable Account

Go to the login page, by https://airtable.com/login

Once logged in successfully in https://airtable.com/ click on **Create a base** (if you have not already done so).

Rename the base to **Servings** and the table to **Cereal**.

In **Grid View**, double click on the column(s) to change their names as follows:

| Atom | Size | Color |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Mi | 5 | #FFFFFF |
| OF | 5 | #FFFFFF |
| MG | 5 | #FFFFFF |
| OM | 5 | #FFFFFF |

Where:
- Mi = Milk
- OF = Oat Flakes
- MG = Multigrain
- OM = Oat Meal

*NOTE*: This should ultimately result in a JSON data file like:
 
 ```
 {
  "nodes": [
    {"atom": "Mi", "size": 5, "color": "#FFFFFF"},
    {"atom": "OF", "size": 5, "color": "#FFFFFF"},
    {"atom": "MG", "size": 5, "color": "#FFFFFF"},
    {"atom": "OM", "size": 5, "color": "#FFFFFF"}
  ],
  "links": [
    {"source": 0, "target": 1,  "bond": 1},
    {"source": 1, "target": 2,  "bond": 1},
    {"source": 1, "target": 3,  "bond": 1}
  ]
}
 ```

## 200 - Create a Personal Access Token on Airtable

See also: https://airtable.com/developers/web/guides/personal-access-tokens

Airtable has deprecated the use of API keys and instead recommends using Personal Access Tokens.

Hence, we'll have to create a Personal Access Token on Airtable.
